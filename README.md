# strawberry
###### reddit version
### image feeder

the reddit version of strawberry takes a subreddit's hot feed of images, saves them to a cache /tmp/ folder, and lets you browse through.
when you exit the image viewer (feh by default), the cache will be deleted.

default dependencies are dmenu, jq, and feh, but these can be changed in the strawberry file itself.
